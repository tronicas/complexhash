Input Processing: The user provides a string or input data.
Complex Transformation: The input is converted into a complex number representation.
Chaos and Randomness: Based on a series of chaos-driven operations (like randomization), parts of the input are transformed into random characters or numbers.
Hyperreal Exponentiation: The algorithm uses hyperreal numbers to introduce irrational exponents to the transformations.
Final Hash Generation: The transformed input is then converted into a final unique cryptographic hash, with characters and numeric values mixed in
